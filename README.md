# MazeSolver
An ASCII maze solver for the [Datastructures and algorithms project-course](https://tiralabra.github.io/2020_p3/) at University of Helsinki

## General info and scope of project
I will be implementing an ASCII-art maze solver in Java. The program will read a maze(or multiple) from a json file and proceed to solve it/them. The aim is to be able to compare how maze solving algorithms and regular pathfinding algorithms behave when presented with a maze. In which cases do the maze solving algorithm do better and vice versa.

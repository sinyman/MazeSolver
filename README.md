# MazeSolver
A maze solver for the [Datastructures and algorithms project-course](https://tiralabra.github.io/2020_p3/) at University of Helsinki

## General info and scope of project
I will be implementing a maze solver program, that takes a maze generated by [Daedalus](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm) and solves it with either of the following algorithms; Wallfollower, Tr√©maux or Dead-end filling. The program will return the initial maze with a route mapped out on it.

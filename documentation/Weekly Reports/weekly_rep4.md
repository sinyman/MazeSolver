# Weekly report 4
This week I decided that making a graph is most likely not going to be worth it, so I refactored my project to work with a 2D array of strings.
### What's been done?
* Refactor Maze reader to create 2D stringmazes
* Implemented Wallfollower
* Created some supporting code for implementing Tremaux later
* Got JaCoCo working
* Worked out how to test my code
### What have I learned?
-
### Problems?
* Tremaux and Dead-end implementation
* Documentation 
### What am I to do in week 4?
* Work out some more of the documentation
  * Coding on the project is getting seemingly more difficult, because I don't really have a distinct line to follow
* Coding
* Write tests

Time used this week: 8h /

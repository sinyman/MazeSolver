# Weekly report 3
Like last week, the beginning of the week was quite slow and I got around to working on the project later on in the week.

### What's been done?
* Coded a working maze IO
* Began working on turning the mazes into graphs
* Began cleaning up project structure
* Planning on how to implement the algorithms with pen and paper

### What have I learned?
* How to implement wallfollower, and gotten more insight in Tremaux and Dead-end

### Problems?
* JaCoCo doesn't seem to want to work.
  * Execution skipped due to 'missing execution data file'
* Not really having a clear picture of how to test my program
* Program efficiency with larger mazes
  * How can I run large mazes more efficiently?
  
### What am I to do in week 4?
* Work out some more of the documentation
  * Coding on the project is getting seemingly more difficult, because I don't really have a distinct line to follow
* Coding
  * Wallflower done
  * Graph generation working
* Read up on testing
* Write tests
* Get JaCoCo working

# Weekly report 1
This week has been slow as far as this course is concerned. I was quite busy and toward the end of the week I got stomach flu
and didn't really have a lot of motivation to work on the project.

### What's been done?
* Mostly reading up on tech and algorithms
* Specified project spec better
* Wrote code for a preliminary file/maze IO

### What have I learned?
* How the mazes are to be generated
* ImageIO. How I can manipulate the maze data
### Problems?
* How to implement wallfollower algorithm. More specifically how to keep track of the direction I am going to make correct turns at junctions
### What am I to do in week 2?
* A lot of coding
  * Get one of the algorithms working as intended
* Read up on testing
* Write some tests
* Get jacoco working
* Write a usage guide

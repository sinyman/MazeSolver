# Project Specification

## Datastructures used
As specified in the course details, I will only be using arrays, primitive types and strings.
With these I will create the data structures and/or algorithms I need.
These are:
  * Array
  * Priority Queue
  * Graph for mapping routes in the maze
      - This will be a doubly-linked list
